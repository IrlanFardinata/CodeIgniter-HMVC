# Codeigniter-HMVC
CodeIgniter 3.1.10 with HMVC (With PHP backward functions for each() and list() and code optimisations -> https://github.com/N3Cr0N/HMVC) and Whoops Error Handling Framework -> https://github.com/filp/whoops


# Modular Extensions - HMVC

Modular Extensions makes the CodeIgniter PHP framework modular. Modules are groups of independent components, typically model, controller and view, arranged in an application modules sub-directory that can be dropped into other CodeIgniter applications.

HMVC stands for Hierarchical Model View Controller.

Module Controllers can be used as normal Controllers or HMVC Controllers and they can be used as widgets to help you build view partials.

# Whoops Framework

**Whoops** is an error handler framework for PHP. Out-of-the-box, it provides a pretty
error interface that helps you debug your web projects, but at heart it's a simple yet
powerful stacked error handling system.

- Stand-alone library with (currently) no required dependencies
- Simple API for dealing with exceptions, trace frames & their data
- Includes a pretty rad error page for your webapp projects
- Includes the ability to [open referenced files directly in your editor and IDE](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/docs/Open%20Files%20In%20An%20Editor.md)
- Includes handlers for different response formats (JSON, XML, SOAP)
- Easy to extend and integrate with existing libraries
- Clean, well-structured & tested code-base
